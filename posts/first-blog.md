This is my custom markdown page which I created as the time I finished this project tutorial from nextjs official website. It was so fun and amazing to learn this framework especially coming from the react perspective. I'm so amaze on how the file system routing is made easy in this framework it reminds me of building my first HTML and PHP code which is **GREATE**
